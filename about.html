        I am an 8-th grade student from a small state called Kerala in India.
        I love learning new stuff. So, One day i started learning Python.
        Yes, Python was the first language i chose to learn. <br>
        I'm still learning it.
        After then, I jumped over to Web Development. <br>
        So, i started learning Front-End Development and this website is a project for it.</p></div> <br>
